Assessment
In the assessment you will implement a linear model for a set of 20 x/y data points.

We assume that the data can be described by a straight line with the slope a through the origin and an intercept b.
y = a * x + b

> Task 1
    Read the x/y data points from the file datapoints.csv into Python
> Task 2
    Create a scatterplot of the data.
> Task 3
    Set the slope a to 10 and the intercept b to 0. Calculate y for every value of x.
> Task 4
    Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of y and ytrue using the formula:
    MSE = 1/N * ∑(y−ytrue)^2
    Where ytrue is the data from the CSV file.
> Task 5
    Find a value for a that gives the lowest possible MSE. Implement the following procedure:
    - increase a by 0.1
    - re-calculate y using the modified a
    - re-calculate the MSE
    - check if the new MSE is smaller than the previous one if it is smaller, use the new value for a, otherwise discard it
    - repeat the procedure 100 times
    - print the final value for a and the MSE 
> Task 6
    Also modify b in the above procedure.
> Task 7
    How could the algorithm be improved? Write down one or two ideas.
> Hints
    - the implementation must be done in Python
    - do not use any existing linear regression functions
    - you may use pandas or numpy
    - use any Python plotting library you like. Do not use Excel for plotting.
